After you create an animation, combine it into a single sprite sheet, and save this animation in /assets/animations/
next you need to click save and save this xml file into the same folder (IT MUST HAVE THE SAME NAME AS THE IMAGE TO WORK)
example: (inside /assets/animations/ )  playerRun.jpg & playerRun.xml
Now in the playstation mobile studio, right click the animations folder in the solution explorer, and click add -> add files from folder.
Select the two files that were created from the sprite sheet tool and add them to the project.
Now these files will appear in the solution explorer, you must right click on the xml file and go to properties.  
A new window will appear on the right, drag this out so you can see all of the contents.  
You need to change the build action to 'Content' otherwise the xml file will not be added to the project when you build it.  
The playstation mobile studio automatically adds images and sound files, but with xml you have to make sure it adds them.
Otherwise the game will run and it wont be able to find the files, and there will be problems :)
